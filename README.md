# 🌿 Rooted in Wellness — Project Development Notes

## Overview
Rooted in Wellness is a calming, nature‑inspired mental‑health microsite designed to help users slow down, breathe, and understand their emotional landscape. The site blends Bootstrap’s responsive structure with custom CSS to create a gentle, grounded user experience.

---

## 🌿 Purpose of the Site
The purpose of Rooted in Wellness is to promote mental health awareness through a calm, supportive, and beginner‑friendly digital experience. The site provides:

- Simple explanations
- Grounding exercises
- Gentle guidance  

It helps users recognise common emotional patterns and manage stress in an accessible way.

---

## 🌱 External User’s Goal
The site is designed for users who want:

- Accessible, beginner‑friendly information about mental health
- Clear explanations of common emotional experiences
- Simple tools to help manage stress and overwhelm
- A supportive, organised layout that feels safe and easy to navigate

> Focus: Meet users where they are — offering clarity, reassurance, and gentle guidance without overwhelming them.

---

## 🌼 Site Owner’s Goal
As the site owner, the aim is to create:

- A welcoming, calming webpage that introduces basic mental‑health concepts
- A layout that is clean, organised, and emotionally supportive
- A design built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, demonstrating responsive structure and thoughtful styling
- A user experience that feels grounded, gentle, and easy to explore

> The project showcases how front-end development tools can create a digital space that supports wellbeing through both content and design.

## 🌳 Design Rationale: Why a Nature Theme?
The site uses a nature‑inspired visual identity because natural environments are widely recognised as calming, grounding, and emotionally restorative. Research shows that spending time in nature — or even viewing nature-based imagery — can reduce stress, regulate emotions, and improve wellbeing.

Design choices include:

- **Palette:** soft greens, warm neutrals  
- **Shapes:** rounded components, organic curves  
- **Visual rhythm:** parallax backgrounds and gentle spacing  

This theme supports mental-health focus by:

- Creating a calm, non-clinical atmosphere  
- Helping users feel safe and grounded  
- Reinforcing that wellbeing can be nurtured gently  
- Offering a visual rhythm that mirrors breathing and reflection tools  

> Nature theme is intentional — not just aesthetic — to make the site soothing, supportive, and accessible.

---

## User Value
Users benefit from:

- Guided breathing exercises with a visual animation  
- Clear explanations of emotional states using a tabbed interface  
- Bite‑sized wellbeing insights in a responsive carousel  
- Affirmations displayed over a parallax background  
- A curated toolkit of resources using Bootstrap Icons  
- A fully responsive layout that feels natural on mobile and desktop  

> The site is intentionally simple, calm, and supportive — a gentle companion rather than an overwhelming interface.

# 🌿 AI-Assisted Development Reflections (Learning Objective 5)

## 5.1 AI-Assisted Code Creation
AI tools supported the development process by helping generate structural code aligned with my design goals. I identified the components I wanted to build — such as the tabbed interface, carousel layouts, and responsive sections — and used AI to produce initial code patterns that I then customised and refined.  

This allowed me to move more quickly from concept to implementation while keeping full creative control over the final design.

---

## 5.2 AI-Assisted Debugging
During development, I encountered several issues with layout behaviour, responsiveness, and Bootstrap class interactions. I identified these problems myself and used AI tools to:

- Diagnose underlying causes  
- Suggest potential fixes  
- Clarify flexbox alignment issues  
- Resolve z-index conflicts  
- Improve mobile behaviour  

> Using AI in this way reduced debugging time and supported my understanding of why the issues were happening.

---

## 5.3 AI-Assisted Optimisation for Performance & UX
AI also supported optimisation work after I identified areas needing improvement through testing and observation.  

Once issues were recognised — such as overly complex CSS, unnecessary motion on mobile, or inconsistent spacing — I prompted AI for guidance on:

- Simplifying CSS selectors  
- Improving animation timing  
- Refining responsive layouts  

> These AI-assisted adjustments helped create a smoother, more accessible user experience.

---

## 5.4 Reflection on AI’s Role in the Workflow
AI acted as a **supportive tool** throughout the project, helping me work more efficiently **without replacing my decision-making**.  

I remained responsible for:

- Identifying problems  
- Defining design intentions  
- Shaping the user experience  

AI contributed by offering:

- Explanations  
- Alternative approaches  
- Code suggestions  

> Overall, AI enhanced the development process by improving clarity, speed, and confidence while keeping me firmly in control of the project’s direction.
